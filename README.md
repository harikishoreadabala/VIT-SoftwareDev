# I have written the code in java.
save the code with Hitwicket.java
First it takes the input of mode of the game 
Then it takes the batman and bowler type
Now for each ball the bowler bowled it will randomly generate the ball type and takes the input from the user which shot he wants to play
For each ball it will update the score board.


Since I had little bit of time I developed only console based application and I couldn't complete the UI part as well the database etc.,
